# UIUC CS 418 MP 3 - Environment Mapping
## Project Description
Creation of a teapot mesh (from an obj file) inside of a skybox with an envrionment map. Two different environments were used: London was provided by the professor while the Bardeen Quad was created with Google Street View. Additionally, these environments were used to "shade" the teapot with a reflection and a refraction. Phong shading through the Phong Reflectance Model was also added as an option.
